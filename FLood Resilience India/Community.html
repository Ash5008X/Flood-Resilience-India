                    <li>Name: Gurjit Singh</li>
                    <li>Location: Gobindghat, Uttarakhand</li>
                    <li>Flood Event: Uttarakhand Floods (2013)</li>
                    <li>"I remember the night the floods hit. It was late, and the priest raised the alarm, warning us of the impending disaster. The heavy rains had already begun, but we never expected the chaos that followed. Water surged into our town, engulfing everything in its path.In the midst of the panic, I grabbed my 12-year-old son, Rana, and we ran. We had to walk over dead bodies, and the sight was horrifying. It felt like we were in a nightmare. But somehow, we made it to safety.Now that we are out, I feel like we have been given a second life. The trek to safety was long and exhausting, but it taught us the value of resilience and the importance of family. We lost so much, but we are grateful to be alive and together."</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>Story 2:</h4></li>

                    <li>"Just bring me poison will you, I want to die" - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/mumbai-residents-count-cost-rain-floods" id="link">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/mumbai-residents-count-cost-rain-floods</a></li>
                    <li>Location: Mumbai</li>
                    <li>Flood Event: Mumbai Floods (2017)</li>
                    <li>Savita Kharve, a 45-year-old woman living on the streets, described the horrific conditions during the floods. She and her family were unable to find shelter and had not eaten for days. Savita's story illustrates the extreme vulnerability of the homeless population during 
                        such crises, as they struggled to survive in knee-high floodwaters.
                        “We have been sitting and sleeping on these steps, because they are a bit higher up, for days now,” said Rajput, as her daughter sat behind her picking lice out of her hair. “We can’t cook, there is no clean drinking water. The water was up to our waist. Not a single thing 
                        was dry. The rich are OK, but we’re out here with nothing.”
                        Dr Deepak Amarapurkar, 59, a senior gastroenterologist at Bombay hospital, was also among the victims of the extreme weather. He had decided to walk the 10-minute journey through the flooded roads on Tuesday to his home, despite his colleagues advising him to wait until the waters had receded.
                        On the way, he fell into an open manhole. Onlookers tried to pull him out, but were only able to retrieve his umbrella. Locals said they had removed the manhole lid to help the water level go down. His body later washed up on the shore at Worli, nearly 2.5 miles (4km) away.</li>

                    <li>Deva Das was jolted awake by the sound of rushing water and falling boulders. He quickly gathered his family and fled to higher ground, where they waited for hours in the rain. Upon returning to their village, they found it nearly unrecognizable, with homes buried under mud and debris. 
                        Deva expressed the profound loss felt by the community, stating, “It was a happy village. Now everything is lost.” His family is currently staying at a relief center for displaced individuals.</li>

            <p>Flood survivor advocacy is essential for creating a more resilient future in the face of increasing flood risks.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Educating Communities</li>
                <ul class="data">
                    <li><b>Statistics:</b> The NDMA reports that floods have affected over 100 million people in India over the past decade, leading to significant loss of life and property.</li>
                    <li><b>Impacts:</b> Raising awareness about flood risks and preparedness can significantly reduce casualties and economic losses. For instance, communities that have implemented early warning systems have seen a reduction in fatalities by up to 50%.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Influencing Policies</li>
                <ul class="data">
                    <li><b>Policy Gaps:</b> Despite the frequency of flooding, many regions lack adequate flood management policies. The 2019 Global Climate Risk Index ranked India as the 5th most affected country by climate-related disasters.</li>
                    <li><b>Advocacy Impact:</b> Engaging with policymakers can lead to stronger regulations regarding flood management, urban planning, and climate resilience. For example, the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) emphasizes the need for integrated flood management strategies.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Mobilizing Resources</li>
                <ul class="data">
                    <li><b>Community Involvement:</b> Increased awareness can lead to greater community involvement in relief efforts. The 2020 Kerala floods saw over 1,000 volunteers mobilized within days of the disaster, providing immediate assistance to affected families.</li>
                    <li><b>Attracting Support:</b> Advocacy can attract attention from national and international organizations, leading to additional resources for affected areas. For instance, the United Nations and various NGOs have provided significant aid during major flooding events.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Building Resilience</li>
                <ul class="data">
                    <li><b>Sustainable Practice:</b> Promoting sustainable practices, such as afforestation and better land-use planning, can enhance community resilience. The NDMA has noted that restoring wetlands can reduce flood risks by absorbing excess rainwater.</li>
                    <li><b>Preparedness Training:</b> Communities that engage in regular disaster preparedness training are better equipped to respond effectively. Studies show that such training can improve response times by up to 30%.</li>
                </ul>
